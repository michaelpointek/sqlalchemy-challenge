This worksheet was completed as a part of the University of Pennsylvania, Data Science Bootcamp. 

The analysis was completed using 2 files. One is a jupyter notebook while the other is a python file. 

The Jupyter file is used to analyze a sqllite database of measurements from weather stations in Hawaii. 
The Python file generates an API using Flask. This API includes the following:
  Routes for precipitation
  Routes for observed temperature
  Station information
  
It also includes a dynamic route that returns summarized temperature information based user-defined start and stop dates. 

This was completed with the assistance of ML models such as ChatGPT3.5
